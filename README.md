## Data Description
Quoted from the [website](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/si650winter11)

```
This is a text classification task - sentiment classification. Every document (a line in the data file) 
is a sentence extracted from social media (blogs). Your goal is to classify the sentiment 
of each sentence into "positive" or "negative". 

The training data contains 7086 sentences, already labeled with 1 (positive sentiment) 
or 0 (negative sentiment). The test data contains 33052 sentences that are 
unlabeled. The submission should be a .txt file with 33052 lines. In each line, 
there should be exactly one integer, 0 or 1, according to your classification results.
